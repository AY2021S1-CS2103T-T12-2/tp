## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
<img src="images/tCheckLogo.png" width="200" height="200" />

Welcome to the User Guide of **tCheck**!
 
Are you a bubble tea store manager (from T-Sugar) looking to reduce your time spent on administrative work in store
management? Look no further, as tCheck can assist you with these tasks.

tCheck is a desktop application that offers an integrated system to efficiently manage a bubble tea shop, of 
the (imaginary) brand T-sugar, by providing sales tracking, ingredient tracking and manpower management. It is an
application optimized for the Command Line Interface (CLI); this means that you use this application by typing
commands into a _Command Box_. If you are a fast typist, then you will be able to update and retrieve the
information in tCheck more efficiently, as opposed to using other applications that requires a mouse.

This User Guide will help you get started with tCheck and learn how to use the features that tCheck provides.
You can start from the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section to learn how to obtain tCheck to begin managing
 your store more efficiently.

### 3.2 Reading this document <a name="reading-this-document"></a>

This section introduces you to some key technical terms, symbols and syntax that are used throughout this guide.
You may want to familarize yourself with them before moving on to the next section.

#### 3.2.1 Terminology related to the GUI

Figure 2 shows the GUI of **tCheck**, annotated with descriptions for all components of the GUI.

<img src="images/tCheckInfographic.png" width="1000" height="700" />
Figure 2 - Annotated GUI of tCheck

#### 3.2.4 Prefix process and usage

The table below explains some important features of how prefix(es) are processed in tCheck to help you understand and use prefix(es) in commands.

Situation | What will happen
-------|------------------------------
Duplicate (2 or more) valid prefixes detected | Only the last prefix and its following parameter are accepted and processed as part of the command.
Invalid prefix entered | tCheck will not recognize this "prefix" and thus it will be processed as part of the parameter for the nearest previous valid prefix, which may result in error for the parameter.
Unexpected prefix(es) entered for commands which do not take in any parameter | tCheck will not accept or process these prefix(es) because all words entered after the command words will be ignored. 

**Example 1:**
`i-set i/Milk i/Boba m/90`

**How the command is processed:**

In this example, the situation of duplicate valid prefixes detected takes place. Hence, only the last, in this case, the second prefix and its following parameters are accepted.
Thus, the command will be processed in the same way as `i-set i/Boba m/90`.

**Example 2:**
`i-set-all M/10 P/10 B/10 L/10 G/10 S/10 T/10`

**How the command is processed:**

In this example, the prefixes `M/`, `P/`, `B/`, `L`, `G` and `S/` are valid but `T/` is invalid. Hence, the situation of
invalid prefix entered takes place. Since tCheck will not be able to recognize the `T/` entered as a prefix. Thus, it will be treated as
part of the parameter for the nearest previous prefix, which is `S/`. This will cause the command to fail because `10 T/20` is an invalid format for amount and appropriate error message will be shown.

**Example 3:**
`help i/Milk i don't know what to do `

**How the command is processed:**

In this example, `help` is a command which does not take in any parameter. Hence, the situation of unexpected prefix(es) entered for commands which do not take in any parameter takes place.
Thus, tCheck will ignore all words come after the command word `help` and the command will be processed in the same way as `help`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Features <a name="features"></a>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `i-set i/INGREDIENT_NAME m/AMOUNT`, both `INGREDIENT_NAME` and `AMOUNT` are parameters which can be used as `i-set i/Milk m/90`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `...`â€‹ after them can be used once or multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `sales A/NUM B/NUM C/NUM ...` can be used as `sales BSBM/100` or `sales BSBM/100 BSBBT/120`.


* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

   * Unit for liquids (Milk, Black Tea and Green Tea) : **L**<br>

* All ingredients' initial levels (the levels you see when running tCheck for the very first time) are set to 0.<br>

* Recording ingredients' leves to the nearest **KG**/**L** is sufficient for inventory keeping.<br>

* tCheck is designed specifically for an imaginary bubble tea brand, T-Sugar, which produces all their drinks using six ingredients. Hence, all available ingredients in a T-Sugar store are pre-defined in tCheck's ingredient book and no other ingredient can be added.<br>

* Please note that the ingredient names are **case-sensitive** to ensure consistency with the ingredient names displayed in Ingredient Tracker section of the _Main View_.<br>

* Please be informed that a prefix is chosen for an ingredient using the following logic : 
   1. Use the first letter of the ingredient name. 
   2. If that letter is taken by another ingredient, use the first letter of the second word for that ingredient. 
   3. If the ingredient name does not have a second word or if the first letter of the second word is not unique, use the second letter of the first word of the ingredient name.

* Here is a comprehensive list of all available ingredients and their pre-determined default levels in a T-Sugar bubble tea store:<br>
    * Milk, 50 L<br>
    * Pearl, 20 KG<br>
    * Boba, 20 KG<br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about Employee Directory:**<br>

If _Employee Directory_ currently shows a list of archived employees (archived employees are displayed with a red
 color label, named as "[Archived]", in front of the name), command `c-active-list` needs to be used first to see a
  list of all your employees. Then, `c-archive INDEX` can be used to archive a specified employee identified
  by `INDEX`.<br>
</div>

Example:

Let's say one of your employees, Alex Yeoh, is no longer working in your bubble tea shop. But he may come back
to work again in the future. You, as a store manager, want to remove him from your employee directory without
permanently deleting his information, so that you can retrieve/move back his information to your
employee directory when he comes back to work again. To archive the first employee, Alex Yeoh, in the sample data, you
can follow these instructions:
 
1. Type `c-archive 1` into the _Command Box_.
2. Press "Enter" to execute.


Outcome:

1. The _Result Display_ will show a success message with the employee's name that you have archived.
2. Alex Yeoh's information will be removed from Employee Directory inside the _Main View_.

* All archived employees (refer to `c-archive` to see how to archive an employee) will be stored in the archived
 Employee Directory. You may refer to `c-archive-list` to view the archived Employee Directory.<br>

* If _Employee Directory_ currently shows a list of archived employees (archived employees are displayed with a red
 color label, named as "[Archived]", in front of their names), command `c-active-list` needs to be used first to see a
  list of all your employees. Then, `c-archive-all` can be used to archive all employees.<br>

</div>

Example:

Let's say after you familiarize yourself with tCheck, you want to remove all sample data in employee directory. But
 you don't want to permanently delete those data, so that you can use them as a reference in the future. To archive
  all employees, you can follow these instructions:

1. Type `c-archive-all` into the _Command Box_.
2. Press "Enter" to execute.


Outcome:
1. The _Result Display_ will show a success message.
2. All employees will be removed from Employee Directory inside the _Main View_.

* The `INDEX` **should not be larger than** the total number of employees listed in the current
Employee Directory inside the _Main View_. For example, there are 2 employees listed in the current Employee
 Directory inside the _Main View_. The `INDEX`should be less or equal to 2.<br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about Employee Directory:**<br>
* All employees who are currently working in the shop are active/unarchived employees. They are stored in the active
(unarchived) Employee Directory. You may refer to `c-active-list` to view the active (unarchived) Employee Directory
.<br>

* All archived employees (refer to `c-archive` to see how to archive an employee) will be stored in the archived
 Employee Directory. You may refer to `c-archive-list` to view the archived Employee Directory.<br>

* If _Employee Directory_ currently shows a list of active/unarchived employees (Archived employees are displayed with a
 red color label, named as "[Archived]", in front of their names. While employees in the active/unarchived employee list
  don't have this red label.), command `c-archive-list` needs to be used first to see a list of all your archived
  employees. Then, `c-unarchive INDEX` can be used to unarchive a specified
   employee identified by `INDEX`.<br>

</div>

Example:

Let's say one of your ex-employees, Alex Yeoh, is now rehired to work in your bubble tea shop. Since he worked in
 the store before, and you archived his data when he left last time. Now, instead of typing his information again and
  use `c-add` command to add him into your employee directory. You can just unarchive him
 and move his data to your employee directory. You can follow these instructions:


1. Type `c-unarchive 1` into the _Command Box_.
2. Press "Enter" to execute.


Outcome:

1. The _Result Display_ will show a success message with the employee's name that you have unarchived.
