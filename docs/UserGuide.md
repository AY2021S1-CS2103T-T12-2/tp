<img src="images/tCheckLogo.png" width="200" height="200" />

Welcome to the User Guide of **tCheck**!
 
Are you a bubble tea store manager (from T-Sugar) looking to reduce your time spent on administrative work in store
management? Look no further, as tCheck can assist you with these tasks.

tCheck is a desktop application that offers an integrated system to efficiently manage a bubble tea shop, of 
the (imaginary) brand T-sugar, by providing sales tracking, ingredient tracking and manpower management. It is an
application optimized for the Command Line Interface (CLI); this means that you use this application by typing
commands into a _Command Box_. If you are a fast typist, then you will be able to update and retrieve the
information in tCheck more efficiently, as opposed to using other applications that requires a mouse.

This User Guide will help you get started with tCheck and learn how to use the features that tCheck provides.
You can start from the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section to learn how to obtain tCheck to begin managing
 your store more efficiently.

## 5. FAQ <a name="FAQ"></a>

**Q**: Why does tCheck ignore additional or extra input that I add after single-word commands, like `help`? <br>
**A**: Any extra input after a single-word command, for example, the input `123` inside the input `c-list 123`, will
 be ignored because extra input does not affect the operation conducted by `c-list`. These single-word commands
 include: `s-list`, `s-rank`, `i-set-default`, `i-list`, `i-reset-all`, `i-restock`, `c-list`, `c-today`, `c-tomorrow`,
  `c-clear`, `c-archive-all`, `c-archive-list`, `help`, `exit`.
