### 3.2 Reading this document <a name="reading-this-document"></a>

This section introduces you to some key technical terms, symbols and syntax that are used throughout this guide.
You may want to familarize yourself with them before moving on to the next section.

#### 3.2.1 Terminology related to the GUI

Figure 2 shows the GUI of **tCheck**, annotated with descriptions for all components of the GUI.

<img src="images/tCheckInfographic.png" />
Figure 2 - Annotated GUI of tCheck

#### 3.2.4 Prefix process and usage

The table below explains some important features of how prefix(es) are processed in tCheck to help you understand and use prefix(es) in commands.

Situation | What will happen
-------|------------------------------
Duplicate (2 or more) valid prefixes detected | Only the last prefix and its following parameter are accepted and processed as part of the command.
Invalid prefix entered | tCheck will not recognize this "prefix" and thus it will be processed as part of the parameter for the nearest previous valid prefix, which may result in error for the parameter.
Unexpected prefix(es) entered for commands which do not take in any parameter | tCheck will not accept or process these prefix(es) because all words entered after the command words will be ignored. 

**Example 1:**
`i-set i/Milk i/Boba m/90`
**How is the command processed:**
In this case, the situation is duplicate valid prefixes detected. Hence, only the last, in this case, the second prefix and its following parameters are accepted.
Thus, the command will be processed in the same way as `i-set i/Boba m/90`.

**Example 2:**
`i-set-all M/10 P/10 B/10 L/10 G/10 S/10 T/10`
**How is the command processed:**
In this example, the prefixes `M/`, `P/`, `B/`, `L`, `G` and `S/` are valid but `T/` is invalid. Hence, the situation is
invalid prefix entered. Since tCheck will not be able to recognize the `T/` entered as a prefix. Thus, it will be treated as
part of the parameter for the nearest previous prefix, which is `S/`. This will cause the command to fail because `10 T/20` is an invalid format for amount and appropriate error message will be shown.

**Example 3:**
`help i/Milk i don't know what to do `
**How is the command processed:**
In this case, `help` is a command which does not take in amy parameter. Hence, the situation is unexpected prefix(es) entered for commands which do not take in any parameter.
Thus, tCheck will ignore all words come after the command word `help` and the command will be processed in the same way as `help`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Features <a name="features"></a>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `i-set i/INGREDIENT_NAME m/AMOUNT`, both `INGREDIENT_NAME` and `AMOUNT` are parameters which can be used as `i-set i/Milk m/90`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `...`â€‹ after them can be used once or multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `sales A/NUM B/NUM C/NUM ...` can be used as `sales BSBM/100` or `sales BSBM/100 BSBBT/120`.


* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

### 2. Commands - Ingredients Tracking <a name="commands-ingredients-tracking"></a>


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

**:information_source: Notes about ingredients:**<br>

* Unit of measurement for ingredients:<br>
   * Unit for solid items / jelly (Pearl, Boba and Brown Sugar) : **KG**<br>
   * Unit for liquids (Milk, Black Tea and Green Tea) : **L**<br>

* All ingredients' initial levels (the levels you see when running tCheck for the very first time) are set to 0.<br>

* tCheck is designed specifically for an imaginary bubble tea brand, T-Sugar, which produces all their drinks using six ingredients. Hence, all available ingredients in a T-Sugar stall are pre-defined in tCheck's ingredient book and no other ingredient can be added.<br>

* Please note that the ingredient names are **case-sensitive** to ensure consistency with the ingredient names displayed in Ingredient Tracker section of _Main View_.<br>

* Please be informed that a prefix is chosen for an ingredient using the following logic : 
   1. Use the fist letter of the ingredient name. 
   2. If that letter is taken by another ingredient, use the first letter of the second word for that ingredient. 
   3. If the ingredient name does not have a second word or if the first letter of the second word is not unique, use the second letter of the first word of the ingredient name.

* Here is a comprehensive list of all available ingredients and their pre-determined default levels in a T-Sugar bubble tea stall:<br>
    * Milk, 50 L<br>
    * Pearl, 20 KG<br>
    * Boba, 20 KG<br>
    * Black Tea, 50 L<br>
    * Green Tea, 50 L<br>
    * Brown Sugar, 20 KG<br>
