## Project: tCheck

tCheck is a desktop application that offers an integrated system to efficiently manage a bubble tea shop, of 
the (imaginary) brand T-sugar, by providing sales tracking, ingredient tracking and manpower management. It is 
optimized for CLI users to update and retrieve the information more efficiently.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
 
* **Implementation**: Implemented model `SalesBook`, and other related models, which are used to store sales tracking
 information.
  * What it does: Allows the app to record the sales data, as given by the user.
  * Justification: This is a necessary step for the app to work as stated.   
 
* **New Feature**: Added ability to add and update sales of drinks.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add and update the sales of drink items, in the Sales Tracker, with a single
   command - `s-update`.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to use the app for sales tracking purposes. It also allows for easy
   correction of errors.
  
* **New Feature**: Added ability to list the sales of drink.
  * What it does: Allows the user to list the sales of drink items in descending order, with `s-list`, in the Sales
   Tracker GUI.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to view the full list of sales recorded. It also informs the user
   which is the drink with the most sales by giving the user a sorted view of the list.
  
* **New Feature**: Implemented the Sales Tracker GUI
  * What it does: Allows the user to see a list of all drink items and their respective sales recorded, in a
   dedicated section of the GUI.
  * Justification: This improves the app significantly because the user will be able to view the recorded sales in an
   organised manner, instead of wordy texts.
