## Project: tCheck

tCheck is a desktop application that offers an integrated system to efficiently manage a bubble tea shop, of the 
(imaginary) brand T-sugar, by providing sales tracking, ingredient tracking and manpower management. It is optimized 
for Command Line Interface (CLI) users to update and retrieve the information more efficiently.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Implementation**: Implemented the `IngredientBook`'s `storage` component, which allows the users to save the
data related to the ingredients in json format. tCheck is also able to load the data from json file when starting 
the application.
  * What it does: Allows the data related to the ingredients to be saved when the user exits the application, 
  and the data will be read by tCheck again when the application starts again.
  * Justification: This implementation will allow the users to view the data related to the ingredients that 
  is stored in tCheck the last time the user uses it. Thus, the user do not need to record the data manually
  each time he or she exits the program. 
  * Highlights: In this implementation, if the user starts with an empty data file, the `IngredientBook` initialized
  will contain the six pre-defined ingredients, each with an amount of 0.

  [\#130](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/pull/130)
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to list the ingredients that require the user to restock with the command `i-restock`.
  * What it does: Allows the user to see the list of ingredients that are in shortage and should be restocked. The feature also allows the user to see the amount of the ingredient required to reach the minimum stock level.
  * Justification: This feature enhances the user experience because without this command, a user would need to check through the list of ingredients to find the ingredients that are in shortage. 
  Since the user needs to check which ingredients should be restocked frequently, this feature saves the user's time and effort in checking which ingredient is in shortage and the amount required to restock.
  * Highlights: The logic of this feature allows ingredients' minimum restock levels to be checked based on whether they are solid or liquid, which makes it more easily extensible in the future when the types of ingredients increase.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find ingredients by keywords with the command `i-find`.
    * What it does: Allows the user to find ingredients which have names containing the keyword(s).
    * Justification: This feature allows the user to search for some particular ingredients quickly by entering keywords. Since our target users are fast typists, it would improve their experience
    using the application as they would not need to scroll down the ingredient list and check line by line to find the ingredients.
    * Highlights: This feature can accommodate the increase in the types of ingredients in the future.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to reset all ingredients' levels to zero with the command `i-reset-all`.

* **New Feature**: Added a command, `i-list`, that allows the user to view the list of ingredients.
