## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.
* can save the ingredient book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### \[Completed\] Set ingredients' levels feature

The completed set ingredients' levels feature consists of three commands with slightly different formats, which complement one another, to provide a set of useful commands for enhanced user experiences. The three commands are :

* `i-set i/INGREDIENT_NAME m/AMOUNT` — Sets the level of one specific ingredient to the specified amount.
* `i-set-default` — Sets the levels of all ingredients defined in the ingredient book to pre-determined amounts.
* `i-set-all M/AMOUNT_FOR_MILK P/AMOUNT_FOR_PEARL B/AMOUNT_FOR_BOBA O/AMOUNT_FOR_OOLONG_TEA S/AMOUNT_FOR_BROWN_SUGAR` — Sets the levels of all ingredients defined in the ingredient book to different specified amounts for each ingredient.

#### Completed Implementation

The completed set ingredients' levels mechanism is facilitated by `IngredientBook`. It implements `ReadOnlyIngredientBook` interface and offers methods to set the application's `ingredientBook`. Particularly, it implements the following three operations:

* `IngredientBook#setIngredient(Ingredient target, Ingredient newAmount)` — Changes the amount the `target` ingredient in the ingredient book to the specified new amount.
* `IngredientBook#setIngredients(List<Ingredient> ingredients)` — Changes the amounts of all ingredients defined in the ingredient book to the specified amounts in `ingredients` list.
* `IngredientBook#setData(ReadOnlyIngredientBook newAmount)` — Changes the amounts of all ingredients defined in the ingredient book according to the `newAmount` ingredient book.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setIngredient(Ingredient target, Ingredient newAMount)` and `Model#setIngredientBook(ReadOnlyIngredientBook ingredientBook)` respectively.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The `IngredientBook#setIngredients(List<> ingredients)` is not exposed in model because it is only used to change the internal states of `ReadOnlyIngredientBook ingredientBook` quickly.
</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the set ingredients' levels mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `IngredientBook` will be initialized with the five pre-defined ingredients, namely `Milk`, `Pearl`, `Boba`, `Oolong Tea` and `Brown Suagr`, with an amount of 0 for all.

![IngredientBookState0](images/IngredientBookState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `i-set-default` to set the amounts of all ingredients to the default levels of the system. The `i-set-default` command calls `Model#setIngredientBook(ReadOnlyIngredientBook ingredientBook)`, causing the initial ingredient book to be replaced by the `ingredientBook` with the amounts of ingredients to be equal to their default levels.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#setIngredientBook(ReadOnlyIngredientBook ingredientBook)`, so the ingredient book will not be changed in the system.

</div>

Step 3. The user finds that the real amounts for one particular ingredient in his/her stall, milk for example, is different from the default level stored in the application and decides to set the amount for milk by executing the `i-set i/INGREDIENT_NAME m/AMOUNT` command. In this case, the exact command entered is : `i-set i/Milk m/100`.
The command calls `Model#setIngredient(Ingredient target, Ingredient newAmount)`, causing the `target` in the current ingredient book to be replaced by `newAmount` .

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If `i-set` command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#setIngredient(Ingredient target, Ingredient newAmount)`, so the ingredient book will not be modified in the system.

</div>

Step 4. After some time of operation, the user decides to update the ingredient book with current amounts of ingredients in his/her stall by executing the `i-set-all M/AMOUNT_FOR_MILK P/AMOUNT_FOR_PEARL B/AMOUNT_FOR_BOBA O/AMOUNT_FOR_OOLONG_TEA S/AMOUNT_FOR_BROWN_SUGAR` command. 
In this case, the exact command entered is :  `i-set-all M/10 P/15 B/20 O/5 S/15`. The command calls `Model#setIngredient(ReadOnlyIngredientBook ingredientBook)`, causing the current ingredient book to be replaced by the `ingredientBook` with different specified amounts for each ingredient.

The following sequence diagram shows how the set ingredients operation works, using `i-set i/INGREDIENT m/AMOUNT` as an example:

![SetSequenceDiagram](images/SetSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `i-set`  command:

![SetActivityDiagram](images/SetActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How set ingredients' levels executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Differentiates into three commands to be able to set one ingredient's amount, set all ingredients' amounts to default levels and set all ingredients' amounts to different levels.
  * Pros: Different commands can suit the needs of the user at different times. In the first few times of usage, the user is still not very familiar with the application and thus may only use `i-set-default` together with `i-set i/INGREDIENT m/AMOUNT` to make adjustments.
  When the user becomes an expert user, he/she can utilize the `i-set-all` command to complete the task of setting ingredients' levels with greater efficiency.
  * Cons: More implementation and testing work required to ensure all commands are working as expected.

* **Alternative 2:** Has only one command :  `i-set i/INGREDIENT_NAME m/AMOUNT`.
  
  * Pros: Easier to implement and test. Theoretically speaking, this one command can achieve the same effect as `i-set-default` and `i-set-all`  by entering it multiple times.
  * Cons: Does not really suit the user's needs because it can be tedious to set each ingredient individually.


### \[Completed\] List ingredients' levels feature

#### Completed Implementation

The completed list ingredients' levels mechanism is facilitated by `IngredientBook`. It implements 
`ReadOnlyIngredientBook` interface and offers methods to view the ingredients' levels from the application's 
`ingredientBook`. Particularly, it implements the following operation:

* `IngredientBook#getFilteredIngredientList()` — Returns the list of ingredients consisting of ingredient names and 
ingredient levels in the ingredient book.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getFilteredIngredientList()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list ingredients' levels mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. If the storage file for the ingredient book is empty, `IngredientBook` will 
be initialized with the five pre-defined ingredients, namely `Milk`, `Pearl`, `Boba`, `Oolong Tea` and `Brown Suagr`, 
with an amount of 0 for all. If the storage file for the ingredient book is not empty, `IngredientBook` will read the  
data from the storage file.

Step 2. The user executes `i-list` to view the list of all ingredients and their levels. The `i-list` command calls 
`Model#getFilteredIngredientList()`, which returns the list of ingredients in `IngredientBook`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list ingredients operation works:
![List Ingredients Sequence Diagram](images/IngredientListSequenceDiagram.png)
#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How list ingredients' levels executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Access the ingredient list and loop through the list to return the list of 
ingredients showing their ingredient names and levels.
  * Pros: Easier to implement and code is more readable.
  * Cons: Every execution of the command will loop through the list once, which can be avoided if an alternative design
  is used.
* **Alternative 2:** Maintain a field in `ingredientbook` that stores the string representing the list of ingredients in
terms of their ingredient names and levels.

  * Pros: Clearer implementation. `IngredientListCommand` will not need to manipulate the list of ingredients during
  execution.
  * Cons: This may result in a slower response of the application since the field would be updated every time the 
  ingredient list is updated.
  
  ## \[Completed\] View a single ingredient's level feature
  
  #### Completed Implementation
  
  The completed view a single ingredient's level mechanism is facilitated by `IngredientBook`. It implements 
  `ReadOnlyIngredientBook` interface and offers methods to view the ingredients' levels from the application's 
  `ingredientBook`. Particularly, it implements the following operation:
  
  * `IngredientBook#findIngredientByName(IngredientName ingredientName)` — Returns the ingredient with the target 
  ingredient name. 
  
  This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#findIngredientByName(IngredientName ingredientName)`.
  
  Given below is an example usage scenario and how the view a single ingredient's level mechanism behaves at each step.
  
  Step 1. The user launches the application. If the storage file for the ingredient book is empty, `IngredientBook` will 
  be initialized with the five pre-defined ingredients, namely `Milk`, `Pearl`, `Boba`, `Oolong Tea` and `Brown Suagr`, 
  with an amount of 0 for all. If the storage file for the ingredient book is not empty, `IngredientBook` will read the  
  data from the storage file.
  
  Step 2. The user executes `i-view-single i/Milk` to view milk's current level. The `i-view-single i/Milk` command is
  parsed by `IngredientViewSingleCommandParser` which parses the ingredient to get the ingredient name and 
  returns an  `IngredientViewSingleCommand`. Logic executes the `IngredientViewSingleCommand` and calls 
  `Model#findIngredientByName(IngredientName ingredientName)`, which returns the ingredient with the ingredient name
  entered by the user.
  
  The following activity diagram shows how the view a single ingredient level operation works:
  ![View a Single Ingredient Activity Diagram](images/IngredientViewSingleActivityDiagram.png)
  #### Design consideration:
  
  ##### Aspect: How find the ingredient's level executes
  
  * **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Obtain the ingredient name of the ingredient entered by the user, and use the
  ingredient name to find the ingredient by looping through the ingredient list.
    * Pros: Code is more readable.
    * Cons: Every execution of the command will require one to access the name of the ingredient and loop through 
    the list once, which may increase the time required for the operation. 
    
  * **Alternative 2:** Map the ingredient entered by the user to a index which corresponds to the index of the 
  ingredient in the list, then find the ingredient using the index.
    * Pros: Do not require looping through the list every time `IngredientViewSingleCommand` executes.
    * Cons: Code may be less readable.
    
## \[Completed\] Reset all ingredients' levels feature
  
  #### Completed Implementation
  
  The completed reset all ingredients' levels mechanism is facilitated by `IngredientBook`. It implements 
  `ReadOnlyIngredientBook` interface and offers methods to view the ingredients' levels from the application's 
  `ingredientBook`. Particularly, it implements the following operation:
  
  * `IngredientBook#getFilteredIngredientList()` — Returns the list of ingredients consisting of ingredient names and 
  ingredient levels in the ingredient book.
  
  This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getFilteredIngredientList()`.
  
  Given below is an example usage scenario and how the reset all ingredients' levels mechanism behaves at each step.
  
  Step 1. The user launches the application. If the storage file for the ingredient book is empty, `IngredientBook` will 
  be initialized with the five pre-defined ingredients, namely `Milk`, `Pearl`, `Boba`, `Oolong Tea` and `Brown Suagr`, 
  with an amount of 0 for all. If the storage file for the ingredient book is not empty, `IngredientBook` will read the  
  data from the storage file.
  
  Step 2. The user executes `i-reset-all` to reset all ingredients' levels. The `i-reset-all` command calls
  `Model#getFilteredIngredientList()`, which returns the list of ingredients in `IngredientBook`. The list of 
  ingredients is checked to see whether all ingredient levels are already at zero. If it is true, the user will 
  be informed that all ingredient levels are already at zero. Otherwise, ingredients that have levels not at zero
  would be replaced by a new ingredient object with the same ingredient name and a zero ingredient level.
  
  The following activity diagram shows how the reset all ingredients' levels operation works:
  ![Reset all Ingredients' Levels Activity Diagram](images/IngredientResetAllActivityDiagram.png)
  #### Design consideration:
  
  ##### Aspect: How reset the ingredients' levels executes
  
  * **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Loop through the ingredient list twice, the first time to check if all 
  ingredient levels are at zero, the second time to replace the original ingredient that has a non-zero ingredient 
  level with a new ingredient with the same ingredient name and a zero ingredient level.
    * Pros: Easier implementation.
    * Cons: Execution of the command may require one to create one or more new ingredients, which may increase the time 
    required for the operation. 
    
  * **Alternative 2:** Loop through the ingredient list twice, the first time to check if all ingredient levels are 
  already at zero, the second time to update the ingredient level to zero.
    * Pros: Clear implementation. Do not lead to creation of new ingredient objects.
    * Cons: Editing the ingredient level may be more error-prone.


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* is the store manager of a T*ger Sugar milk tea shop
* is very busy with daily operations and has little time for manual writing or recording
* is a fast typist
* has many employees (both part-time and full-time) to manage
* needs to save all the employees’ contact numbers
* needs to forward one person’s contact to another
  employee to let them directly communicate with each other 
* cares about the daily revenue
* does an inventory check daily to ensure that ingredients are sufficient
  for the shop to operate smoothly
* needs to keep track of the daily revenue
* prefers desktop apps over other types
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:

* To manage the employees' contact information digitally
    * The product will provide a platform to allow the user to save his/ her employees’ contact 
      information (eg. emergency contacts, address etc).
    * It can manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app 
* To digitise inventory keeping
    * The product will help to digitise inventory keeping, and thus helps to save the user’s time and prevent 
      human error in calculation. It does not ensure that the employees use the same amount of ingredients in making 
      the drinks. The user only needs to enter the number of each type of bubble tea sold on the day. It will notify the user
      which ingredients are running low on stock and remind him/ her to restock them soon. 
    * The product could also help the user calculate the total cost for restocking.
* To digitise daily revenue tracking
    * Given the number of each type of bubble tea sold, the product can provide the user with the revenue for each day.
    * The product also helps Amy to keep track of the daily revenue changes, and the revenue for each type of product. 
      This would allow Amy to check which kind of bubble tea sells better and consider adopting similar ideas when 
      making new products.
