* tCheck is a desktop application that helps bubble tea store managers manage the staffs’ contact information, store’s inventory and historical sales data. It is optimized for CLI users to update and retrieve the information more efficiently.

* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named tCheck, which is a word play on tea Check. The application is used by bubble tea shop managers to check and track their inventory and sales.
